Notice that in this situation we cannot use a HashSet, because HashSets are unable to keep track of the order of the objects within them.

Notice that since both of the subarrays are sorted, we know that the number which will come at the very beginning will be one of the two numbers at the start of both subarrays.

    "As a bonus to the lesson, we can check out what the runtime of this algorithm is.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Computing the runtime in terms of `n` requires adding up the number of operations that happen in terms of `n`. To do this, we can simply run the algorithm for an arbitrarily large array of size `n`, and count the operations as we go:\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Beginning with the array of size `n`, we know we will definitely have to look over `n` items during the merging process. So we can add `n` to our total, and compute the runtime of the subcalls. The subcalls will divide the array into two subarrays of half the size, and the same operation can be applied here. We look over a maximum of `n/2` items for both from merging. This contributes `2 * n/2 = n` operations to the runtime.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Now we just need to add in the runtime of the four subsequent subcalls which will get made to sort the subarrays of size `n/4`. Here we will get `4 * n/4 = n` plus the runtime from the eight subcalls from those subcalls, and so on. We will have to keep repeating this until the subcalls at depth `k`, where `n/(2^k) = 1`. Solving for `k` in terms of `n`, we get `k = log(n)`. This means that once the subcalls at depth `k` have been made, we will have totaled `n + n + ... + n` operations, where the number of `n`s is equal to the depth of subcalls, which we have just computed as `log(n)`. So the total runtime of the merge sort algorithm is `O(n * log(n))`.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Notice that `log(n)` is much smaller than `n`, and therefore `O(n * log(n))` is much more efficient than `O(n^2)`, which was the runtime of our original sorting method.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "In fact, `O(n * log(n))` is provably the fastest possible achievable runtime to sort objects using comparison. There still exist additional techniques which can be used to sort items in `O(n)` in special cases where comparison isn't required to order the objects, but these techniques will not be discussed in this curriculum."
